## Installation
1. Download and install the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
- make sure it's 3.xx.x and for MacOS; that should be the first option in downloads anyway

2. Open a terminal and enter the following:
```
cd PATH
git clone https://github.com/ericwang4904/Canvas_API.git
```
where PATH is the place you want to put the program (`cd Desktop` is a good choice). After you've downloaded the program, type
`cd `

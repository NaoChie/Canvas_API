## Purpose
The purpose of this software is to allow a user to push an module item in one course to a group of other courses, eliminating the need to manually add module items. 

## Installation
1. Downloading and installing Python

Download and install the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure it's 3.xx.x and for MacOS; that should be the first option in downloads anyway

2. Downloading the app

Open a terminal and enter the following:
```
cd PATH
git clone https://github.com/ericwang4904/Canvas_API.git
```
where PATH is the place you want to put the program (`cd Desktop` is a good choice). After you've downloaded the program, type
`cd Canvas_API` to enter the program folder.

3. Installing app requirements

Run the `setup.sh` file (`bash setup.sh` in terminal while in the Canvas_API directory) to install the relevant modules the program is using. Alternatively, just do `pip install requests` to install the latest version, as it is the sole dependancy.

## Setup
1. Setting up the API token
   1. Go to your Canvas homepage > Account > Settings and scroll to "Approved Integrations".
   2. Click "New Access Token", enter a purpose, and click "Generate Token".
   3. Copy down the access token.
   4. Open the `data.json` file in your `Canvas_API` folder.
   5. Paste in your token in the TOKEN_GOES_HERE section.
   6. Return to the Canvas homepage and copy the url, before pasting it into the URL_GOES_HERE section of `data.json`.
   7. It should look like this: `{"API_KEY": "abcd~efghijklmnop", "API_URL": "https://nuevaschool.instructure.com"}` (make sure your url does not end with a `/`!).
   8. Save the file.

2. Setting up the course groups
   1. Open the `data.json` file and go to the `courses_groups` section
   2. Make sure you have a list of courses you want to put in a group. At this point, if you have done step one you can run main.py to see a list of your courses and their IDs.
   3. Format your course groups according the examples in the file (keyâ€“value pairs separated by commas). That is,
   ```
   "courses_groups": {
    "example_1": ["238", "591", "512"],
    "example_2": ["1234567", "1239877", "1857116"]
   }
   ```
   4. IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't put the course that you manually add items to into a course group. If you do, every time you push an item to a course group, you will duplicate the original. Instead, have one course be your "master course" that you modify from Canvas, and put the others into a course group.
   - Example: `Block1` is the master course, course group `"History"` contains `["Block2", "Block3", ..., "Block8"]`

## Using the Program.
Congrats! You're done setting up. Simply run `main.py` to test your code for functionality. Here's an example for how it should work:
1. You create an item "testing" one of your courses "course" under a module "test"
2. You run main from the Python IDLE editor or type `python3 main.py` in your terminal (You'll have to `cd PATH/Canvas_API` first)
3. You select "course"
4. You select "test"
5. You select "testing"
6. You select the course group "test_group"
For every course in "test_group", the program will look for modules named "test" and push the item into that module if found (Make sure that module name is present or that course will be skipped!). In the future (or never), I'm planning on adding delete and update functionality, but those are secondary.
